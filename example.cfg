# Configuration file format
#
# [Input]
# train_location = Path to directory containing training data files. There must be a file for each featureset.
# test_location = Path to directory containing training data files. There must be a file for each featureset. If unspecified, cross-validation is performed.
# featuresets = List of prefixes for the files containing the features you would like to train/test on.
# classifiers = List of sklearn classifiers to try using. Acceptable values are 'logistic', 'svm_linear', 'svm_radial', 'naivebayes', 'dtree', 'rforest', and 'gradient'.
#               logistic = Logistic regression using LibLinear
#               svm_linear = SVM using LibLinear
#               svm_radial = SVM using LibSVM
#               naivebayes = Multinomial Naive Bayes
#               dtree = Decision Tree
#               rforest = Random Forest
#               gradient = Gradient Boosting
# suffix = The file format the training/test files are in. Valid option are '.tsv', '.megam', and '.jsonlines' (one complete JSON dict per line in the file).
#
# [Tuning]
# grid_search = Whether or not to perform grid search to find optimal parameters for classifier.
# objective = The objective function to use for tuning. Valid options are 'f1_score_micro' (micro-averaged f-score), 'f1_score_macro' (macro-averaged f-score), and 'accuracy'.
#
# [Output]
# probability = Whether or not to output probabilities for each class instead of the most probable class for each instance. Only really makes a difference when storing predictions.
# models = Path to directory to store models. Can be omitted to not store models.
# vocabs = Path to directory to store vocabs. Can be omitted to not store vocabs.
# vocabs = Prefix to add to prediction files (will have a "-" separator added automatically). Can be omitted to not store predictions.
